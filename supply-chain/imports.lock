Aims to provide a safe JNI (Java Native Interface) API over the
unsafe `jni_sys` crate.

This is a very general FFI abstraction for Java VMs with a lot of unsafe code
throughout the API. There are almost certainly some edge cases with its design
that could lead to unsound behaviour but it should still be considerably safer
than working with JNI directly.

A lot of the unsafe usage relates to quite-simple use of `from_raw` APIs to
construct or cast wrapper types (around JNI pointers) which are fairly
straight-forward to verify/trust in context.

Some unsafe code has good `// # Safety` documentation (this has been enforced for
newer code) but a lot of unsafe code doesn't document invariants that are
being relied on.

The design depends on non-trivial named lifetimes across many APIs to associate
Java local references with JNI stack frames.

The crate is not very actively maintained and was practically unmaintained for
over a year before the 0.20 release.

Robert Bragg who now works at Embark Studios became the maintainer of this
crate in October 2022.

In the process of working on the `jni` crate since becoming maintainer it's
worth noting that I came across multiple APIs that I found needed to be
re-worked to address safety issues, including ensuring that APIs that are not
implemented safely are correctly declared as `unsafe`.

There has been a focus on improving safety in the last two release.

The jni crate has been used in production with the Signal messaging application
for over two years:
https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/blob/main/rust/bridge/jni/Cargo.toml

# Some Notable Open Issues
- https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/422 - questions soundness of linking
  multiple versions of jni crate into an application, considering the use
  of (separately scoped) thread-local-storage to track thread attachments
- https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/405 - discusses the ease with which
  code may expose the JVM to invalid booleans with undefined behaviour
